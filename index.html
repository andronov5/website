    <h2>READ ABOUT THE SCIENCE</h2>
    <p>
      Machine-learning treats price history as a vast, noisy laboratory and lets the data surface the patterns.
      Feature-importance audits and live performance dashboards convert the “black box” into a glass box traders can interrogate.
      The guiding philosophy is empirical, adaptive, and transparent.

        <h2>ABOUT THE CREATOR</h2>
        <p>
          I’m <strong>Lera</strong> – a teenager who happens to see Wall Street charts as intricate puzzles waiting to be solved.
          I spend my nights remixing market data with predictive algorithms, coaxing tomorrow’s probabilities out of today’s noise.
        </p>
        <p>
          What drives me is the intersection of <strong>machine learning and finance</strong>.
          I’ve built models that flag reversal patterns faster than a trader can blink and dashboards that stream insights in real time.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe the future of markets should be open-source, inclusive, and audacious.
          If one teenager with a laptop can decode the market’s pulse, imagine what an entire generation equipped with data literacy can do.
